# 1StopLighting Clone - React and Node.js CRUD Application

This project is a simplified clone of the **1StopLighting** homepage built using **React (Vite)** for the frontend and **Node.js with Express** for the backend. The project demonstrates the implementation of a **Single Entity CRUD operation** for managing products and connects the backend API to the frontend using RESTful principles.

### **Backend**
